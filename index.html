            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>
              This group project was part of the Business Development lab (ME2073) at KTH.
              Among our partners, we had support from Herman's, Syster o Bror, Sophies Canelé, Café Ruben, Symbios, Sopköket, Trädgårdscafé and Lunchcube.
              After the course, we started negotiations with ResQ Club to handover the business.
              We went beyond the requirements when after four months of work we actually <mark>launched the product</mark>.
            </p>
            <h4>Process</h4>
              <p>
              We wanted to create a sustainable solution for the big problem of food waste.
              Our idea was a marketplace for restaurants to advertise meal deals right before closing time.
              My team was very ambitious, as they wanted to target customers all over Stockholm, but my opinion was that we should <mark>start small</mark>, test it then iterate.
              So we decided to focus on university students and the restaurants around campus.
              We had weekly meetings <b>(Figure 1) </b>and my role in the team was to <mark>update the business model</mark> canvas after them.
              During user research I was also responsible for interviewing students to gather data to validate our idea.
              Whilst the team was developing the prototype, I managed the Facebook page and I created a marketing campaign <b>(Figure 2) </b>around a launch event.
              I was the one planning and <mark>organising the event</mark> so I had to contact partners, invite people and advertise it to teh students.
              In the end we had more than 200 people attending it and it was a great success <b>(Figure 3)</b>.
              After launching, the app was running with special offers for one month at <mark>Herman's</mark>, a famous vegetarian restaurant in Stockholm.
            </p>
            <h4>Results</h4>
          <p>
            It is not easy to start a business from scratch, but I learned a lot about how to <mark>create traction</mark> around an idea.
            The marketing campaign that led to the launch event was a great success and it taught me the power <mark>social media</mark> on advertising a product.
            We received a lot of positive feedback on both our process and our idea.
            I believe this is because we developed something based on user research, for a real need and we targeted a very <mark>specific user group</mark>.
            The combination of these factors helped the proposition to be stronger.
            I can say that feel much more prepared to create a business on my own after this experience.

              <h4>About</h4>
              <p>This Summer I joined the Digital Cities Summer School <b>(Figure 1)</b> organized by EIT Digital during two weeks.
                We had many guest lectures <b>(Figure 2)</b> and a business challenge to work with.
                My brief was the “Call for innovation to enhance Paris’ candidacy: SMART PARIS 2024", proposed by the Committee for Paris Olympics Candidacy.
                The goal was to find ways of capitalizing on this event, to make the city smarter and to leave a positive legacy.
                The case provider highlighted the issues of minimizing the ecological footprint.
              </p>
              <h4>Process</h4>
              <p>
                The first step I took was understanding the problem thoroughly.
                I read the brief, I searched for more examples on the website and I discussed with the group in the end.
                We brainstormed a list of problems related to the Olympics and we all wrote our to it.
                Some of my ideas were a bracelet for cashless purchases during the games, a energy generator embedded in bikes and using recycling to collect points.
                The group decided to go for this last one.
                To work more efficiently, we divided tasks.
                I was responsible for <mark>managing the team</mark>, so I had to keep track of to do list and ask for progress every day.
                I was also working on the <mark>business model canvas</mark> and iterating it according to our new insights.
                I read a lot about <mark>financial forecast</mark> calculation to help my colleague who was responsible for this part, which made me learn more about it.
                I created the visual identity for the pitch and I assigned slides to the other team members.
                In the end I wrote the motivation part of the <mark>business plan report</mark>, a summary about the whole ideation process and some details of the canvas.
              </p>
              <h4>Results</h4>
              <p>
                The deliverables for the Summer Course were a report, two pitches and a business plan.
                Our business idea comes from the need to give citizens more incentives to recycle and to help them to separate the trash.
                We propose the installation of smart trash bins, adding to it a gamification system to award points to the users, to be later exchanged for discounts during the Olympics games.
                My main concern was that this solution requires an initial investment by city government, however, after working on the financial forecast, it turns out to be very profitable in the long term.
                Another issue I raised during our group discussions was on the feasibility of developing smart bins, but secondary research showed that there are already technology to create that.
                It was a great opportunity to practice what I learned on the Entrepreneurship course I had at university and I learned a lot about managing a team.

              <h4>About</h4>
              <p>
                With this project we were one of the winners of the Green Hackathon Smart Cities, Stockholm (12-13th Feb 2016).
                The challenge was to design a solution for the problem of caretakers having to drive themselves to the regular visits to the elderly people in Sweden.
                We had two days and a group of five members to pitch a feasible and sustainable way to improve the current system.
              </p>
              <div>
              <h4>Process</h4>
              <p>
                We had a short time to work on an idea that could prove its value to the judges and to the society.
                Since the beginning, I suggested that our best approach would be to focus on simplicity and feasibility of the solution.
                 We <mark>brainstormed</mark> about the current caretaker issues <b>(Figure 1)</b>so that we could choose one pain point to target.
                 Once we agreed with an idea, we divided tasks and I was responsible for <mark>collecting data</mark> that motivates the need for our proposal.
                 I had to research many government report to scrap data about the elderly population to help calculating the distance driven by the caretakers everyday.
                 In the end, I also implemented a visualization using the <mark>C3 library of d3.js</mark> to show how the cost of elderly care has been increasing in Sweden.
                 The data and the visualization were used on the <mark>pitch</mark> we prepared as a group <b>(Figure 2)</b>.

              </p>
            </div>
              <h4>Results</h4>
              <p>
                We needed to reduce the mileage caretakers drove by car every day, without affecting the quality of care for the elderly.
                 So we designed a solution for caretakers could share rides, preserving quality indicators and following their schedule.
                 Since it was a two days hackathon, I learned a lot about working efficiently under <mark>time pressure</mark>.
                 It also made me realise that I am already capable of applying what I am learning at university to tackle real and important problems.
                 Overall, I really enjoyed giving my time and skills for an idea that I believe can have a <mark>positive impact</mark> in society.
                 We <mark>won first prize</mark> in our category <b>(Figure 3)</b>, because besides improving the sustainability of big cities, our solution did not demand many resources to be implemented.
                 We were invited by <mark>Scania</mark> to work with them for Summer internship in Stockholm.

                    <h4>About</h4>
                    <p>This Summer I joined the workshop "Adventures in Data Visualization" at SUPSI, Lugano, Switzerland.
                    The workshop was an intensive three days course with tutoring sessions from experienced professionals <b>(Figure 1)</b> and a group project.
                    In this year edition, we were asked to explore <mark>Open Data</mark> datasets from Swiss organizations.
                    We had to select, analyse and manipulate the data in order to transform it in a narrative flow and create an interactive experience.</p>

                    <h4>Process</mark></h4>
                    <p>I proposed a division in the team <b>(Figure 2) </b>so we could be more productive.
                      Therefore, we had one member developing the d3.js, one doing the front-end, and another one responsible for wireframing.
                      Most of the time I was peer coding in the <mark>front-end</mark>, because I wanted to learn more about <mark>Bootstrap</mark> and my team member was very good at it.
                      I was doing some of the UX design too, I created <mark>sketches</mark> for the website flow and I chose the colour scheme.
                      <mark>I had the idea of creating a quiz</mark>, asking users to guess the language of a quote, so I had to choose funny quotes and to create the interaction flow.
                      I also manipulated a lot of data.
                      I had to clean and re organize the tables that we found on the Open Data Swiss, because some of its data was not relevant for our project.
                      I used <mark>Excel</mark> for that, because the task did not require a more complex approach.
                      In the end, I did the <mark>usability and functionality test </mark>of the prototype and I passed the issues to my developer colleague.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Results</h4>
                    <p>
                      We called our project "an exploration into the linguistic immigration flows of Switzerland".
                      It displays the many languages spoken by the immigrants who arrived in Switzerland in 2014.
                      By using the metaphor of colourful particles we wanted to express their diversity and the quiz was designed to engage more the users.
                      We exposed it at the Master Fair <b>(Figure 3)</b> at SUPSI Lugano, among the thesis projects there.
                      We also received an invitation from http://muda.co/zurich/ to have our project <mark>exhihited in Zurich</mark> this Fall.

            <h4><mark> Context</mark></h4>
            <p>I worked with a team for the ACM CHI 2016 Student Competition. As the theme of this year's edition was related to assistive techologies, we were designign for stroke patients.
            This project consisted of a protoype, a video and a paper. Based on this experience, I wrote a short paper too, focusing on the challenges and possible guidelines for other designers willing to work for the same group of users.
            This paper was not for CHI Student Competition, but rather for the Research Seminars course (DH2632) at KTH.</p>

            <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
            <p>I was working individually for this paper. The focus was on what I have learned during the design process of a game for stroke patients.
            I described my experiences as well as the challenges I had to face in order to engage more the patients on evaluation.
            I did not very deep on literature review, as I wanted to report my own experience this time.</p>

            <h4><mark> Abstract</mark></h4>
            <p>The motor and speech impairments of many stroke patients make interacting with screen interfaces a challenging activ- ity.
            Consequently, they might be excluded of the possibilities of social contact and entertainment provided by technology.
            Inspired by the movie ”The Diving Bell and the Butterfly”, in which a man has his life completely changed after losing all body movementswe designed ”The Tavern”.
            Our goal was to help them by giving new interactive ways to enjoy positive social experiences during their recovery, however we faced many challenges, as described on this paper.

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>This paper is the project I did for my Bachelor Thesis, which got a distinction in May 2014.
            It investigated Attribution of Responsibility and Sense of Agency using a game I designed and implemented using Unity.
            The project was made in collaboration with Prof. Pim Haselager and Prof. Louis Vuurpijl at Radboud Universitet, Nijmegen, Netherlands. In Brazil, my supervisor was Prof. Andre Campos.
            This paper was <mark>published and presented</mark> at the SBGames Brazil 2014. </p>

            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>This was a project I did most on my own: I was responsible for proposing the research questions, doing the <mark>literature review</mark>, designing the game, analysing the results statistically and write the final paper.
            My research interest was on how users perceived sharing control with an Artificial Intelligent (AI) agent. I came up with the idea of using a game so that we could engage more participants and the task would not be burden for them.
            Then, I designed the commands to be partially under user control and partially under influence of an AI agents. I wanted to observe the behaviour of the users in the case they lose the game and who they would blame for that.
            I coded the game in <mark>C#</mark> and I used the rendering engine <mark>Unity</mark>. I also <mark>designed a website</mark> <b>(Figure 1)</b> that included the game and the questionnaire <b>(Figure 2)</b> for my research.
            The experiment was designed to be fun, intuitive and easy to complete, so that even users were not required any prior knowledge to play it.
            After collecting data from the experiment I used minitab to conduct the <mark>inferential statistical</mark> tests.
            </p>

            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>Once I finished with the analysis I wrote the thesis and a paper, which I submitted it to SBGames 2014.
              As it got accepted <b>(Figure 3)</b> I had to present my work in the conference to an audience of around 100 people. I also had to give the <mark>presentation in English</mark>.
              I got a <mark>distinction mark</mark> for this project for my Bachelor Thesis as well.

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>Solid was the final project for the course of Information Visualization (DH2321) at KTH <b>(Figure 1)</b> on March 2016.
              We were given total freedom on technology, dataset and theme we wanted to explore.
              The goal was to create a visualization to help users to see, to understand and to create their own discussions about a particular topic.</p>

              <h4>Process</h4>
              <p>
                I was part of all the brainstorming sessions in which we explored different ideas and themes.
                My main contribution to it was pointing out how to create a narrative out of the data, instead of merely plotting it to a visual representation.
                Our team organised itself in three tasks: webpage design, scraping data and coding the visualization.
                I was responsible for bringing <mark>user centred design</mark> approaches to the project, so I created simplified personas of possible users to target, with their goals and needs.
                Then, I wrote scenarios based on the data visualization framework of <mark>"overview, zoom, filter, details on demand"</mark>.
                I also did some secondary research on similar projects to both help us to create something new and to serve as inspiration.
                My main responsibility after that was to code the data visualization. At first, the designers wanted to use a Treemap, but after I implemented it, I found out that this visual structure was not representing the data in the correct way.
                After some discussion, me and the designers decided to use a Sunburst <b>(Figure 2)</b> instead. I coded it using <mark>d3.js</mark> and the legend using d3-legend.js.
                For the legend, I created a log scale so that the colours could be better distributed and the differences between nodes would look clearer.
                Finally, I used the <mark>Wikipedia API</mark> to add a description box when the user clicked on a node of the Sunburst.
              </p>
              <h4>Results</h4>
              <p> We created Solid for data journalists and curious people, to help them to discover interesting stories that the media might not give much attention to.
                We combined two data sets to display loss in quality of life due to avoidable causes (DALYs) in comparison with what media covers.
                With this project we won three categories at <mark>C-Awards</mark> in Stockholm <b>(Figure 3)</b>: best Business Opportunity, Best Progress in Science and Best by Popular Vote.
                We recently got contacted by <mark>Gapminder</mark> for a collaboration on their project about the same topic.

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>This project was part of the coursework for the Methodology of Interaction Design (IC2005) course at KTH in November 2015.
              Our task was to follow the brief to the CHI 2016 on <mark>Assistive Technology</mark>.
              After four weeks of work, we came up with a social game to be played by stroke patients in recovery either in the hospital or at home. </p>
            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>Our design process was divided in four phases, one per week: brainstorming, building personas and scenarios, creating sketches and prototypes, and finally evaluation.
            We wanted to work with recovering stroke patients. I proposed to the group that we could try out new brainstorming methods, so we used Six Thinking Hats and <mark>bodystorming</mark> in the hospital.
            For data collection, I did secondary research on previous papers. I also created a survey to be posted at an online forum.
            I also did one semi-structured interviews with medical experts.
            Using the data collected I built <mark>personas and scenarios</mark> to illustrate a situation when our personas would use our device.
            Based on this, I created skecthes <b>(Figure 1)</b> with my colleague on the interaction flow.
            With her help, I created a <mark>hi-fi prototype</mark> using PowerPoint <b>(Figure 2)</b>.
            Then, we went to a hospital to test it with a nurse specialized on stroke <b>(Figure 3)</b>.
            I did a <mark>semi-structured interview</mark>, focusing on the issues that could arise for the patients using our prototype.
            I tested the usability of the prototype using the <mark>Think Aloud</mark> method.
            In the end, I wrote a paper to be submitted to CHI 2016 and my group did a video and a poster.
          </p>
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>For the <mark>CHI 2016 Design Competition</mark> we had to deliver a paper, a poster and a video.
               In the paper, I described previous works, our design process and the outcomes of the evaluation.
               Even though our focus was on recovering patients, not the vulnerable ones, this project showed me it is <mark>extremely challenging to design for patients</mark>.
               The main issue is that it is hard to get permission for direct access to them.
               For this reason we had to collect data either from remote users or from experts, which did not give us many insights.
               As a result, we did not win the competition, however, I have learned a lot about subimiting a paper to an important conference and I am trying again with another project this year.

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>This paper received a <mark>Certificate of Recognition</mark> for bring one of the top four entries at the <mark>Student Design Competition</mark> at CHI 2017.
              It was deisgned to give the underprivileged the power to upload artworks independently, by using a portable camera device. Approved artwork is then shared around the city, reaching larger audiences through public displays. By pressing a heart button embedded in the display, passersby can instantaneously send their appreciation to the artists and further purchase artworks via an online store.  

            </p>
            <h4>User Research and Design</h4>
            <p>The theme for the Student Design Comptetion was: "Level the Playing Field". I had the idea of choosing homeless as user group, becuase they have a real need for a fair playing field. First, I did some <mark>secondary research</mark>and I showed my fidings during a group <mark>brainstorming</mark> session. Then, I went with my teammates to the 240 Project, an activity center for homeless in London, where I conducted semi-structured <mark>interviews</mark> with members and social workers. After the visit, data was summarized in an <mark>affinity diagram</mark>. The main finding was that artisits produced many impressive artworks, however they were barely seen by the public. In order to prepare for the next field visit, I <mark>sketched cards</mark> so that members could sort their needs. Whilist conducting more semi-structured interviews during the second visit, I found that the members wish they could be recognised for their skills and not for their unstable life condition. This served as main design inspiration for StreetHeart. I created personas, sketched scenarios and used a <mark>evaluation matrix</mark> to prioritize features. Then, I used these artifacts as material for the deisgn of <mark>paper prototypes and wireframes</mark> of the interface for the members to document their artwork and the public displays to be placed on the street. Both protoypes were evaluated with real users, through <mark>observations, interviews and Think Aloud</mark>. 


            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>I learned that it is not easy to have the whole group to agree with an idea, however, by <mark>voting and compromising</mark> it was possible to combine and create a solution that turned out to be better than any of the individual ideas. I also learned how important it is to <mark>listen to the users </mark>and guide every deisgn decision on their real needs, not on personal opinions. Me and my team worked hard for this project and it payed off, because we were selected among 70 entries to participate at the CHI 2017, in Denver. We presented our work in a poster session with other 11 groups and we were selected to present it again for the wide audience at the final round. All competitiors had really good projects, and even thought we did not win fist place, it was a great achievement to be among the <mark>best four</mark>. The paper was also published by the <mark>ACM Proceedings</mark> for CHI 2017.
